# Chthonic Metal
A very basic turn-based fighting game in SFML, made for my school's C++ course.
#### Final grade: 9.5/10 :D

![Animated GIF of the main menu. On the top in the middle it says "Chthonic Metal" in a spiky font. There are start and quit buttons and a highscores list. In the background is a very fancy fire simulation](.github/readme_assets/MainMenuScreen.gif)
![The character selection screen. There is choice between three Pookmans, all with badly drawn sprites: an orange dragon Chorizo, a yellow mouse Pukechoo and a blue turtle Scoot](.github/readme_assets/CharacterSelectionScreen.png)
![The fight screen. On the left is Scoot and on the right is Pukechoo, with the text "Enemy" hovering over. Both Pookmans have a health and stamina indicator. On the bottom is text saying "Enemy gambled and did 5 damage!" and to the right of that are four buttons: "Attack", "Gamble Attack (5-15)", "Heal" and "Rest"](.github/readme_assets/FightScreen.png)
![The same as last image, but the player's Scoot's health has dropped to -2, the buttons have disappeared and the text says "You died! Your score was 2"](.github/readme_assets/FightScreenDeath.png)
